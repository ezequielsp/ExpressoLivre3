1. New Queue management
2. Calendar resources ACL
3. Import Scripting interface

1. New Queue management
-----------------
- Configuration options for the Redis queue backend have been added to the setup.php
  config tool.

2. Calendar resources ACL
-----------------
- ACL has been added to calendar resources. You might have to check the resources
  in the Admin/Applications/Calendar/Settings dialog. You need READ grant to "invite"
  resources to events and EDIT grant to change the status. An update script adds the
  READ grant to all users if no other grants have been defined for the resource.
  
3. Import Scripting interface
-----------------
- With the new import scripting interface you can implement your imports in any 
  given language.
- This way you can use your existing infrastructure and knowledge to import any 
  data from any given source into Tine 2.0.
